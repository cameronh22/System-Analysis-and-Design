# System-Analysis-and-Design

The DriverPass system is a system that allows for customers to get training and Driving experience before they take your driving test. Customers can sign up on the website, and then they can schedule appointments to drive or take practice tests. The practice tests are kept up to date, so that they make sure you learn all the new rules and laws in the driving system. I think in my systems I made it clear what the client wanted and made sure to include that in all my diagrams. 

In my Use Case diagram I didn't explain how the system works very well, and if I could I would completely remake the diagram. I would add more actors to the diagram to make it so that the system is more complex. I made my diagram super simple and didn't include all of the parts.

When designing a system I would be sure to get all of the details from the client. You don't want to leave anything out, because if you forget something when desiging a system the client might request it later, and it could cost you a lot of money to add it in.
